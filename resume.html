Skills<br>

I am a very hardworking and quick learner. I understand how to get the job done as efficient as possible. I have self taught myself the bare basics of Java and PHP, but I want to learn more and become more proficient in programming. I am a good problem solver and if I get stuck in something I attempt to always find another way around the issue. <br>
